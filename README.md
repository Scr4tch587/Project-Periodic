# Welcome to Project Periodic!

This game was developed to fulfill the CAS Project requirement of our IB Diploma. 

The concept was a wave-based survival game where players dispose of hordes of enemies using various acids, gases, and chemical reactions. The game was intended for use in classroom settings, as students could learn more about different chemicals and properties as they were unlocked. 

Due to the intense stress of IB, we never finished the game beyond a primitive, demo state, but it is technically playable. 

Find some screenshots of the game below!
